**`A Level 1 crook trying to level up his way up`**

Greetings! I am an rookie developer from Indonesia, filled with passion for learning and growing in the world of programming. While I may be relatively new to the field, I am determined to expand my knowledge and skills to become a proficient developer. Apart from my coding journey, I find joy in two other great passions of mine, gaming and sports. Exploring virtual worlds and challenging my strategic thinking through games has been an integral part of my life. Additionally, I am an avid sports enthusiast, eagerly following various sports events, which keeps me motivated and inspired.
